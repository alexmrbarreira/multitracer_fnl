	These galaxy bias data were generated elsewhere using Separate Universe IllustrisTNG simulation data

	The data are for the bias parameters $b_1$ and $b_\phi$ for 

		- redshifts       , z = 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3              ,
		- number densities, n_g = 5e-4, 2e-4, 1e-4 h^3/Mpc^3 ,

	as well as for the full sample and equal-number multi-tracer splits according to

		- g-r color (grcolor)
		- stelar mass (stemass)
		- total mass (totmass)
		- black hole mass accretion rate (bhmmdot)
		- galaxy local density (ngalax8)
		- halo concentration (c200)
